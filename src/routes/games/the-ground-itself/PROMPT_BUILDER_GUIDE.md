# Prompt Builder Guide - The Ground Itself

## Overview

The prompt builder system is the **heart of the game** - it transforms player narratives into AI-ready prompts using **simple, predictable templates**. The complex system has been replaced with clean templates that match exact game specifications.

## Current Status: SIMPLE TEMPLATE SYSTEM ✅

**Implementation**: Simple template-based approach  
**Integration**: Perfect service layer architecture maintained  
**Usage**: All image generation flows through 5 core templates  
**Ready for**: Easy testing and prompt optimization  

---

## Simple Template Architecture

### **Service Layer Flow (Unchanged)**
```
Components → gameActions.js → imageService.js → promptBuilder.js → API
```

**✅ Perfect Abstraction**: Components never call prompt builder directly  
**✅ Centralized Control**: All prompts flow through single service  
**✅ Simple Templates**: Predictable, testable prompt generation  

### **5 Core Templates**

#### **1. Initial Setup Template**
Used when first establishing the place with stock image:
```
"This is "The Ground Itself" a storytelling game about a single place over time. IMPORTANT: Everything happens in this one location. The camera is anchored to this place and cannot move outside this frame or show events elsewhere.

The location is [location]. This image should just be in this style: [style]."
```

#### **2. Setup Phase Template (Face Cards)**
Used during world-building with face card questions:
```
"This is "The Ground Itself" a storytelling game about a single place over time. IMPORTANT: Everything happens in this one location. The camera is anchored to this place and cannot move outside this frame or show events elsewhere.

The location is [location]. This image should just be in this style: [style].

The player is establishing this place. Take this image and modify it while keeping the location consistent according to the question and answer

Question: [question]
Answer: [answer]"
```

#### **3. Main Gameplay Template**
Used during main game with numerical card questions:
```
"This is "The Ground Itself" a storytelling game about a single place over time. IMPORTANT: Everything happens in this one location. The camera is anchored to this place and cannot move outside this frame or show events elsewhere.

The location is [location]. This image should just be in this style: [style].

The story continues in this place. Take this image and modify it while keeping the location consistent according to the question and answer

Question: [question]
Answer: [answer]"
```

#### **4. Time Gap Template**
Used when "10" cards trigger time jumps with all 3 changes:
```
"This is "The Ground Itself" a storytelling game about a single place over time. IMPORTANT: Everything happens in this one location. The camera is anchored to this place and cannot move outside this frame or show events elsewhere.

The location is [location]. This image should just be in this style: [style].

This location has just gone through a time gap. Time has moved [forward/backward] [amount] [unit]

The players have described the changes as such:
[Question/answer 1]
[Question/answer 2] 
[Question/answer 3]

Remember to keep the camera on the same location from the previous image, it can change drastically or very little but the "camera" is anchored."
```

#### **5. End Game Template**
Used for final "what happens tomorrow" conclusion:
```
"This is "The Ground Itself" a storytelling game about a single place over time. IMPORTANT: Everything happens in this one location. The camera is anchored to this place and cannot move outside this frame or show events elsewhere.

The location is [location]. This image should just be in this style: [style].

This is the final image of our place. The story concludes with this vision of tomorrow:

[final answer]

Show the ultimate state of this place, keeping the camera anchored to the same location we've been following throughout the entire story."
```

## Enhanced Style System ✅

### **User Input Priority**
1. **Custom user input** (if provided) - highest priority
2. **Selected dropdown option** (if no custom input)
3. **Random selection** from 8 predefined options
4. **Default fallback**: "atmospheric, digital painting, high detail"

### **Implementation**
```javascript
function getImageStyle(state) {
    // Custom style takes priority
    if (state.customImageStyle && state.customImageStyle.trim()) {
        return state.customImageStyle.trim();
    }
    
    // Selected style second
    if (state.imageStyle && state.imageStyle.trim()) {
        return state.imageStyle.trim();
    }
    
    // Random selection third
    if (imageStyleOptions && imageStyleOptions.length > 0) {
        const randomIndex = Math.floor(Math.random() * imageStyleOptions.length);
        return imageStyleOptions[randomIndex];
    }
    
    // Final fallback
    return CONFIG.defaultStyle;
}
```

---

## Simple Configuration

```javascript
const CONFIG = {
    debugMode: true, // Set to false in production
    defaultStyle: 'atmospheric, digital painting, high detail'
};
```

**No complex length management** - Templates are self-contained  
**No smart truncation** - Important context never gets cut off  
**No priority systems** - Simple template selection based on game phase

## PROMPT ENGINEERING OPTIMIZATION GUIDE

### **Phase 1: Current State Analysis**

**✅ Strengths of Current System**:
- User voice perfectly preserved
- Game context clearly communicated
- Phase-appropriate strategies implemented
- Smart length management working
- Rich context system ready for optimization

**⚠️ Optimization Opportunities**:
- Prompt structure refinement for specific AI models
- Context prioritization tuning
- Style instruction enhancement
- Model-specific length optimization

### **Phase 2: Optimization Strategies**

#### **1. Model-Specific Tuning**
```javascript
// Optimize CONFIG for target AI model
const CONFIG = {
    maxPromptLength: 1000,       // Adjust for model limits
    placeDescriptionLimit: 250,  // Optimize for model attention
    recentNarrativeLimit: 400,   // Balance context vs. focus
    debugMode: false             // Production setting
};
```

#### **2. Prompt Structure Optimization**
```javascript
// Current structure works well, but can be optimized:
// [Game Context] + [Place Foundation] + [Current Narrative] + [Time Context] + [Style Instructions]

// Potential optimizations:
// - Reorder sections based on AI model attention patterns
// - Add emphasis markers for critical information
// - Optimize transition words between sections
```

#### **3. Context Prioritization Refinement**
```javascript
// Current priority system can be tuned:
function buildPromptFromSections(sections) {
    // Optimize priority order based on testing results
    const priorities = [
        { key: 'gameContext', essential: true, weight: 1.0 },
        { key: 'placeFoundation', essential: true, weight: 1.0 },
        { key: 'currentNarrative', essential: false, weight: 0.8 },
        { key: 'timeContext', essential: false, weight: 0.6 },
        { key: 'styleInstructions', essential: true, weight: 0.9 }
    ];
}
```

#### **4. Style Instruction Enhancement**
```javascript
// Current style instructions can be expanded:
function getStyleInstructions(state) {
    let instructions = '';
    
    if (state.imageStyle) {
        instructions += `Style: ${state.imageStyle}. `;
    }
    
    // Optimization opportunities:
    // - Add composition guidance
    // - Include lighting preferences  
    // - Specify perspective consistency
    // - Add mood/atmosphere keywords
    
    instructions += 'High detail, atmospheric, immersive. Focus on the place itself rather than individual people.';
    return instructions;
}
```

### **Phase 3: Testing Framework**

#### **A/B Testing Setup**
```javascript
// Create prompt variants for testing
export function buildImagePromptVariant(state, options = {}, variant = 'default') {
    switch (variant) {
        case 'concise':
            return buildConcisePrompt(state, options);
        case 'detailed':
            return buildDetailedPrompt(state, options);
        case 'structured':
            return buildStructuredPrompt(state, options);
        default:
            return buildImagePrompt(state, options);
    }
}
```

#### **Quality Metrics**
```javascript
// Track prompt effectiveness
const promptMetrics = {
    coherence: 'Visual consistency across images',
    relevance: 'Accuracy to player narrative',
    evolution: 'Appropriate visual progression',
    atmosphere: 'Mood and style consistency'
};
```

### **Phase 4: Production Optimization**

#### **Performance Tuning**
```javascript
// Production configuration
const PRODUCTION_CONFIG = {
    maxPromptLength: 900,        // Optimized for target model
    placeDescriptionLimit: 220,  // Tested optimal length
    recentNarrativeLimit: 350,   // Balanced context
    debugMode: false,            // No debug output
    cachePrompts: true,          // Cache similar prompts
    optimizeForSpeed: true       // Prioritize generation speed
};
```

#### **Error Handling Enhancement**
```javascript
// Robust prompt building with fallbacks
export function buildImagePromptSafe(state, options = {}) {
    try {
        return buildImagePrompt(state, options);
    } catch (error) {
        console.error('Prompt building failed:', error);
        return buildFallbackPrompt(state);
    }
}
```
