### **`ARCHITECTURE_PLAN.md`**

Alien in the Machine

This document outlines the architectural philosophy and technical design. It is the single source of truth for _how_ we build and _why_ we build it this way.

#### **1. Core Philosophy**

- **Build to Learn:** Our goal is to understand architecture. Code should be written for human readability first. Use descriptive variable names, write extensive JSDoc comments explaining the _intent_ of functions and data structures.
- **Iterate and Rebuild:** This prototype is disposable. Do not over-engineer solutions for problems we don't have yet. Build the simplest thing that satisfies the current phase's requirements.
- **AI as a Collaborator:** The AI agent writes code; the human architect reviews it. The code must be transparent and easy to reason about. This means avoiding overly clever or opaque code. Functions should be small and have a single responsibility.

#### **2. Core Architecture: "Toy" Entity-Component-System (ECS)**

The entire state of the game is contained within a single JavaScript object we call the `world`. This pattern enforces a complete separation of data and logic.

- **Entity:** A simple number (ID). It is nothing but a key.
- **Component:** Pure data. Stored in the `world` object, indexed by entity ID.
  - **Technical Example:** `Entity #5` is a marine named "Rook" in the medbay. This is represented as:
    ```javascript
    world: {
      components: {
        isMarine: { 5: { name: 'Rook' } },
        position: { 5: { roomId: 'medbay' } },
        health:   { 5: { current: 90, max: 100 } }
        tag:      { 5: { name: 'marine_rook' } }  // We use this for debugging
        // Note: Entity #5 has no 'inventory' component yet.
      },
      // ... other world data
    }
    ```
  - To find where Rook is, you query `world.components.position[5]`. To see if an entity is a marine, you check `if (world.components.isMarine[entityId])`.
- **System:** A pure function that takes the `world` object as an argument, performs logic, and often returns a set of changes to be applied. It is the "verb" to the component "noun."

#### **3. Data Flow: Anatomy of a Turn**

This is the precise, non-negotiable order of operations for a single game tick.

1.  **UI Interaction:** A player clicks a debug button or enters a command. The Svelte component _does not modify the world directly_. It calls a manager function, pushing a structured action object into `world.actionQueue`.
2.  **Turn Trigger:** A central `nextTurn()` function is called.
3.  **`aiSystem` Runs:**
    - It queries for all entities with an `AIControlComponent`.
    - For each, it generates a prompt and calls the `LLMService`.
    - It pushes the returned action from the LLM into the `world.actionQueue`.
4.  **`actionSystem` Runs:**
    - It iterates through every action in the `world.actionQueue` in order.
    - It executes the logic for each action, directly modifying the `world.components` data.
    - After processing all actions, it clears the `world.actionQueue`.
5.  **`missionSystem` Runs:**
    - It checks the state of components to see if any objective conditions are now met. It might set a `world.gameState` flag (e.g., from 'PLAYING' to 'WON').
6.  **State Commit:** The `nextTurn()` function completes.
7.  **Store Update:** The _final, fully updated_ `world` object is passed to the `worldStore.set(world)` method.
8.  **UI Reactivity:** Svelte detects the store change and all subscribed components (MapView, InfoView, etc.) re-render automatically, displaying the new state of the world.

#### **4. Module Responsibilities**

- **`World.js`:** Defines the shape of the `world` object and provides helper functions for creating entities and attaching components. It is the **database schema**.
- **`systems.js`:** Contains all core game logic (AI, actions, missions). These are the **business logic** functions. They are the only modules that should be modifying the `world` object.
- **`/data/*.json`:** The raw content. These files should know nothing about the game engine. They are **pure data**.
- **`/stores/*.js`:** The public API for the UI. Svelte components should **only** interact with the game engine through these stores (and any exposed manager functions).
- **`/components/*.svelte`:** The presentation layer. These components should be "dumb." They read from stores and display data. They emit user events to be handled by the game logic.
