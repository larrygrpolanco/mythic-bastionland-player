Warfare

RECRUITMENT
Soldiers are drawn from loyal Vassals, Knights that share a cause, or mercenaries who have agreed a price.
Whatever their origin, soldiers expect their basic needs to be met during their service.
Warbands who are ill-rested, poorly fed, or otherwise pushed too far typically lose SPI. At SPI 0 a Warband will not follow orders, acting only in their self interest.

WARBANDS
Two-dozen or so combatants fighting together are treated as a single Warband.
• When they are Mortally Wounded they are routed from the battle.
• At VIG 0 they are wiped out entirely, at SPI 0 they are broken.
• They are not harmed by individual attacks unless they are Blast attacks or suitably large-scale.
• Warband attacks against individuals receive +d12 and cause Blast Damage.

LEADING FROM THE FRONT
One individual within a Warband can add their Attack dice to the Warband’s Attack Roll, leading from the front. If they do, they suffer the same Damage that the Warband does until their next turn.

WOOD AND STONE
Ships and structures are destroyed at 0GD. Recovering GD takes a day of repairs.
Wooden structures and ships ignore Attacks other than from fire, siege weapons, or suitably large creatures.
Stone walls cannot be breached by conventional means, though their gates are usually a viable target.

Colliding ships take d12 Damage. If one ship is much larger it takes d6 Damage instead.
