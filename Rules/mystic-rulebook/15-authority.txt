MUSTERING TROOPS
A typical Seat of Power can muster 3 Warbands, other Holdings 2. The Marshal determines their training and armament.

TAXES, TITHES, & LEVIES
Standard collections (p17) keep the Domain running without too much strain. A Steward can squeeze more from their Vassals for a war or great project, but must roll:
INCREASED COLLECTIONS
1 Immediate misrule.
2-3 Your coffers are filled, but take a Crisis.
4-6 The Vassals pay willingly, mostly.

COURTLY CONFLICT
Courtiers breed problems, especially when they hold leverage over their ruler, whether family influence, dark secrets, or military might. Here a ruler must tread carefully, as obvious solutions always leave at least one party feeling mistreated.
Every Season brings some drama. Spark Tables (p22) can help to describe this.
Roll to see how youâ€™re involved:
DRAMA IN COURT
1 You are personally involved.
2-3 You are involved by association.
4-6 You are not involved.

SUCCESSION
Typically a ruler names their successor, though some Realms defer the decision to a conclave of Seers or a group of specially chosen Knights-Elector.
Whoever the successor, they are sure to face at least some resistance, and should quickly establish their own authority.

CONQUEST
Knights live between two worlds. One of rank, oath, and rule of the worthy. The other of chaos, brutality, and rule of the strong.
Often, having the audacity to seat yourself in a Holding is enough to make you the ruler.
Holdings and Realms seized by force and left unchallenged tend to have a period of turmoil before adapting to the new status quo.

GRAND DESIGNS
Work on existing buildings or infrastructure is generally completed by the next Season.
New buildings or infrastructure can be completed in a Season.
Grand projects such as castles and roads require an entire Age of work.
