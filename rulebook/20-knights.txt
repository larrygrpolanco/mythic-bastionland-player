Knights
Roll d6 and d12. Read the d6 first. Pages list the d6 in a square, d12 in a pentagon.
Each Knight can be used for a player character or non-player Knights who are encountered wandering or ruling.
Generally each player should have a different type of Knight.
Some Realms refer to Knights by honorific titles and ranks, others their given name and home, while most use their full knightly title or simply “Knight.”
This is not an exhaustive list, and even those listed Knights may differ as the mantle is passed on.
Each page also includes the Seer who granted their Knighthood, witnessing the pledging of their Oath.
