Knighthood

You are Knights, united by a common Oath and visions of the City. You may have dreams of glory, but every Knight must accept the risk of death.
The Seers who knighted you have deemed that you travel as a Company. While some of you may rest, roam, or die, your collective journey will be as one.

Knights have 3 Virtues. Roll a value for each in order. The Start that you chose for your Company determines the dice you roll. If unsure, roll d12+d6.

VIGOUR
Strong limbs, firm hands, powerful lungs.

CLARITY
Keen instinct, lucid mind, shrewd eyes.

SPIRIT
Charming tongue, iron will, fierce heart.

Roll for Guard (GD), your skill at avoiding Wounds. The Start that you chose for your Company determines the dice you roll. If unsure, roll d6.

Roll or choose a Knight (p26).
This gives:

Ability: A special talent unique to you.
Passion: A special means you have to restore your Spirit.

Every Knight has a dagger (d6), torches, rope, dry rations, and camping gear.

Every Knight has sworn the Oath:
SEEK THE MYTHS
HONOUR THE SEERS

SQUIRES
Small Companies (2 Knights or fewer) may give each Knight a Squire. They serve as apprentices, and are not yet Knights, so cannot gain Glory or perform Feats.
