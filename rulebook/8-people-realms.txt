SERVICE
Holdings house a range of people who can be called on for service. The larger the Holding, the more likely that a particular service is being offered there.
Many will gladly offer their service to a Knight, but all have limits, after which they ask something in return or refuse entirely.
As with trade, the key question comes down to “What can I offer that they would value?”.
Common services are offered everywhere.
Uncommon services require training.
Rare services require a lifetime dedication.

REALMS
• The world is fractured into petty Realms, each ruled from a Seat of Power.
• Smaller Holdings are walled settlements tended by Vassals, guarded by Knights.
• Most that lies between is wilderness.

MYTHS
• Stories that became truths, or are destined to come to pass.
• Nobody agrees on the details, but every version is true in some way.
• There’s no such thing as “just a myth”.

ROLES
• Most fall into one of four roles: Vassal, Vagabond, Knight, or Seer. A web of seniority exists within and between each.
• Vassals serve a ruler, typically a Knight, in return for protection.
• Vagabonds roam, working for and protecting only themselves.

SEERS
• Those who understand the nature of Myth enough to glimpse into our future.
• Their visions grant legitimacy and direction to a Knight’s quest.
• They know when a Squire is ready to become a Knight, and when a Knight is ready to seek the City.

KNIGHTS
• Those who take the Oath are held in esteem, but expectations burden them.
• They rely on their arms, but are expected to know the customs of peace.
• Usually one Knight holds each title, passed on in retirement or death.

FAITH
• Some believe there is truth in the sky: the stars, moon, sun, positions, and motions.
• Some look to nature: the turn of seasons, the sound of trees, the wisdom of beasts.
• Some believe the sacred stories that weave into Myths, guiding us to the City.
