Time

Each Day has 3 Phases:
• Morning: Sunrise to Noon.
• Afternoon: Noon to Sunset.
• Night: Sunset to Sunrise.

Each Year has 3 Seasons:
Spring - The Green Season
• Begins with the Feast of the Sun, a day of excess and revelry to strengthen both the people and the land.
• Midspring sees Sceptremass, where the Seat of Power gathers local rulers to renew their vows of loyalty.
• Ends with the Tax, a share of coins collected by the Realm.

Harvest - The Gold Season
• Begins with the Feast of the Stars, a night of honours, unions, and contests.
• Midharvest sees Eldermass, a secretive assembly of Seers and trusted associates.
• Ends with the Tithe, a share of food and drink collected by the Realm.

Winter - The Grey Season
• Begins with the Feast of the Moon, a solemn reflection of mortality and history.
• Midwinter sees Kindlemass, a sacred day of warmth and goodwill, where each home must open their doors to all.
• Ends with the Levy, a share of materials and crafted goods collected by the Realm.

Each Life has 3 Ages:
• Young: Green, always learning.
• Mature: Seasoned, in their golden years.
• Old: Grey, considering their legacy.

When a character becomes Mature they reroll each Virtue on d12+d6 and keep the result if higher.
When a character becomes Old they reroll each Virtue on d12+d6 and keep the result if lower. Old characters lose d12 VIG at the end of each Age. If this takes them to VIG 0 they die peacefully.

ADVANCING TIME
At the end of each session, or during a natural break in their journey, the group decides how much time will reasonably pass:
• None: Pick up where you left off.
• Weeks: Continue on to the next significant seasonal event.
• Months: Move to the next Season.
• Years: Begin a new Age in Spring.

If uncertain, roll:
