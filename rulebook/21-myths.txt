Myths
Roll d6 and d12. Read the d6 first. Pages list the d6 in a square, d12 in a pentagon.
Each Myth lists its Omens and the cast of beings who are associated with it.
Entering or exploring the Mythâ€™s Hex always reveals its next Omen, remembering Primacy of Action (p16).
The Hex itself is visually tied to the Myth.
When the group feels that a Myth is resolved the Knights each gain 1 Glory and a new Myth replaces it in the next Season.
Myths may appear at odds with their Realm, such as The Sea in a desert.
Still, these Myths must be brought to pass, so Realm and Myth can shift as needed.
